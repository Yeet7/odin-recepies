            <li> 1 cup heavy whipping cream </li>
            <li> 1 cup boiling water </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder </li>

            Steps:
        </h3>
        <ol id="ol">
            <li> Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish. </li>
            <li> Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to create a double boiler. Whisk together the
                egg
                yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl until the sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased
                slightly
                in volume, and it looks light yellow. Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers to ensure it feels
                smooth and silky. </li>
            <li> Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and continue whisking rapidly over the double
                boiler
                for about 10 minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. Remove the bowl from the
                double boiler and set aside until cooled to at least 90°F or room temperature. </li>
            <li> Beat the mascarpone on medium speed for 15 to 30 seconds, until it smooths out and softens. Gradually
                add
                the cream in a thin, slow stream until it's all incorporated. Continue beating with the mixer on
                medium-high
                speed for another 30 to 60 seconds, until the mixture holds firm, not-quite-stiff peaks. </li>
            <li> Fold 1/3 of the whipped mascarpone-cream mixture into the zabaglione to lighten it, then fold in the
                remaining 2/3. </li>
            <li> In a wide, shallow dish, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the remaining 1 ounce (2 tablespoons)
                of
                rum, the boiling water, and the espresso powder. Stir to dissolve the sugar and espresso. </li>
            <li> Dunk one ladyfinger at a time in the espresso liquid, turning it so that all sides are evenly moistened
                — a
                quick dunk is all you need; any more and the ladyfingers start to disintegrate. Arrange the dunked
                ladyfingers in rows on the bottom of the baking dish. Once you finish the layer, spread 1/2 of the
                mascarpone mixture over the top. Repeat dunking and arranging a second layer, and spread the remaining
                mascarpone over top.</li>
            <li> Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours to give the tiramisu time to
                firm
                up and for the ladyfingers to soften. </li>
            <li> Dust with cocoa before serving. Serve in wedges directly from the pan. Leftovers will keep for about 5
                days. </li>
        </ol>
